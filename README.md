## The Code Bug Project
Code Bug is a developing project which aims to help developers learn to code by developing a series of increasingly advanced applications. Each tutorial will be released as a written blog post on my [website](www.erinnmclaughlin.com) and as a video walk-through on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4M_NlMdP7a2TK2PNQioXQ).
