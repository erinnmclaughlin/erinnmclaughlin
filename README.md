Hi, I'm Erin. I make **C#** and **ASP.NET Core** related content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/erinmclaughlin), and on my [website](https://erinnmclaughlin). My goal is to help bridge the gap between "learning" and "doing" by building [demo applications](https://github.com/blazorbuilds) that are fun and interesting while also demonstrating important concepts within C# and .NET programming. 

As a self-taught developer still early in my career: **I am still learning**. I am by no means an expert in the field of .NET development and I know how difficult it can be to overcome the initial learning curve and start translating concepts and ideas into real-world applications. But now that I started to get a firmer grasp on the .NET landspace, I wanted to create a resource that I feel would have been helpful to me when I was first starting out.

Whether you're a new developer or an experienced pro, I believe we all can offer something of benefit to help each other learn and grow. Always feel free to leave constructive feedback, and we can all learn together as we go!
